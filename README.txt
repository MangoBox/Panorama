Hello Everybody!
I am MangoBox, and I am the developer of Panorama.
Panorama is a mod for Minecraft 1.8, hopefully featuring now and in the future:
- A Rogue-Like System with tons of 3D-rendered special tools, items and armor
- Many Gadgets useful for daily Minecraft use, hopefully implementing various APIs in the future

-------------------------------------------
Notes:
1.This mod is WIP and extremely buggy, do not be afraid to post issues as I need to fix them. :)
2.I am the currently the only developer so please do not ask to help, that is my choosing to do so.
3.Any part of this mod may be changed at any time with or without notice.

Hope you stay updated :D
